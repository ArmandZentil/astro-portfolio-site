            <p>
              In my early 20's I pursued a career in the entertainment industry. As a film director the first<a
                  class="text-sm hover:underline duration-200 dark:text-white" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WJFjXtHcy4"> video I ever made</a>  went viral and ended up being nominated for "best music video" at the 2011 MTV VMA's.
                  </p>

            <p>
              Following the success of my first project I went on to produce/direct a number of projects for well known artists such as <a
                  class="text-sm hover:underline duration-200 dark:text-white"  href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWesI0husPY">Kid Ink</a>, <a
                  class="text-sm hover:underline duration-200 dark:text-white" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qoi5LF9NDvo">SpaceGhostPurrp</a>, <a
                  class="text-sm hover:underline duration-200 dark:text-white" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZ8O7ByHIxQ">Dom Kennedy</a> and more. I also had a few-year stint managing artists such as <a
                  class="text-sm hover:underline duration-200 dark:text-white" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudpvck">Kenny Beats and Ryan Marks</a>, <a
                  class="text-sm hover:underline duration-200 dark:text-white" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHssbYOk3eo">Eliana</a>, <a
                  class="text-sm hover:underline duration-200 dark:text-white" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PueKPtlg64A">Quadie Diesel</a>, and <a
                  class="text-sm hover:underline duration-200 dark:text-white" href="http://www.classickstudios.com/Epidemic">oscar-nominated engineer/producer Epidemic</a>. As a consequence of the grind and lifestyle of talent management I eventually became burnt out. This resulted in me pivoting into the fields of music publishing and royalty investing.
            </p>
            <p>
              After retiring from the music industry I went back to school <a
                  class="text-sm hover:underline duration-200 dark:text-white" href="https://junocollege.com/course/javascript/">(coding bootcamp)</a> to pursue web development. I also took some finance/accounting courses at the <a
                  class="text-sm hover:underline duration-200 dark:text-white" href="https://learn.utoronto.ca/accounting">University of Toronto<a/>. Using my new-found skills and entrepeneurial spirit I was able to acquire a <a
                  class="text-sm hover:underline duration-200 dark:text-white" href="https://searchyellowdirectory.com">website</a> and develop it to a level where it is getting a significant amount of traffic and users every month. I was able to set up AdSense and affiliate parnters which enabled me to generate a decent amount of profit. 
            </p>
            <p>
              This sparked my interest and now career path of investing in and building web applications and SASS businesses. It is now my goal to build a portoflio of businesses and brands that generate over 100M+ in profit annually. 
            </p>

              Some of my skills include leadership, creativity, vision, finance, hiring, management, data analytics, and an array of technical skills [video editing, photo editing, audio engineering, html/css/js, node, react, astro, tailwind, excel, firebase, SQL, AdSense, Google Analytics and more... ].
