                Now, this is a story all about how My life got flipped-turned
                upside down And I'd like to take a minute Just sit right there
                I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air
              </p>

              <p>
                In West Philadelphia born and raised On the playground was where
                I spent most of my days Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin', all cool
                And all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school When a couple
                of guys who were up to no good Started making trouble in my
                neighborhood I got in one little fight and my mom got scared She
                said, "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air"
              </p>

              <p>
                I begged and pleaded with her day after day But she packed my
                suitcase and sent me on my way She gave me a kiss and then she
                gave me my ticket I put my Walkman on and said, "I might as well
                kick it"
              </p>
              <p>
                I begged and pleaded with her day after day But she packed my

                kick it"
              </p>
              <p>
                First class, yo this is bad Drinking orange juice out of a
                champagne glass Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like?
                Hmm, this might be alright
              </p>
              <p>
                But wait, I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that Is this the
                type of place that they just send this cool cat? I don't think
                so I'll see when I get there I hope they're prepared for the
                prince of Bel-Air
              </p>
              <p>
                Well, the plane landed and when I came out There was a dude who
                looked like a cop standing there with my name out I ain't trying
                to get arrested yet, I just got here I sprang with the quickness
                like lightning, disappeared
              </p>
              <p>
                I whistled for a cab and when it came near The license plate
                said, "Fresh" and it had dice in the mirror If anything I could
                say that this cab was rare But I thought "Nah, forget it, yo,
                holmes to Bel Air"
              </p>
              <p>
                I pulled up to the house about seven or eight And I yelled to
                the cabbie, "Yo holmes, smell ya later" I looked at my kingdom I
                was finally there To sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-Air
